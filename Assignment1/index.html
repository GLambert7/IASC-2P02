<h2>1. Flatness</h2>
<span class="Clickable" id="part-one">Inside the cave </span>

lies a civilization.The civilization knows nothing but the inside of their cave and the stories told by the shadows on the cave wall.  <span class="Clickable" id="first-change">Each morning the sun god Ra appears on the cave wall and begins his flight across the sky.</span> At the end of his voyage, Ra descends into the underworld. As Ra makes his way closer and closer to the entrance of the underworld the civilization in the cave slowly loses sight of him until he disappears completely. Worshipping Ra for generations, the civilization prays to him, sings to him, and provides him offerings, but most of all they use his daily travel through the sky to tell time. Every morning when they awaken he has already begun his venture, and every night when he finishes his crossing they know it is now time to go to bed. <span class="Clickable" id="second-change">Sometimes Ra will pause in the middle of his journey</span>, when this happens time stops and civilization graciously accepts the gift of a longer day from Ra. Even though he may stop sometimes Ra always finishes his flight. If he were to fall from the sky and fail to complete the trip it would be chaos. Civilization would go into mass panic and all hope would be lost. And so, as he had for generations, Ra completed his flight, and the civilization rested, secure in the order of their world.

  <p>Nick Sousani’s concept of flatness is having a lack of originality, and following the same paths as others without leaving one's comfort zone. Conforming to society's stiff structure will inevitably lead to missing out on countless opportunities. Within the cave, the civilization perfectly represents this flatness through the worship of its “god”. Every day they wake up and blindly follow Ra without giving it a second thought just because it is what their ancestors have done for generations. They dedicate their lives to Ra putting so much time and effort into pleasing him and helping him make his flight. Being stuck with this flat mindset, staying in the cave and following the path left by their ancestors the civilization loses many opportunities. Without this mindset, civilization would progress quickly, discover new religions, and each person would develop an original personality. All they must do is leave the cave and stop living in the shadows and a whole world of opportunity and progress will open up. But as long as they remain in the cave, bound by tradition, they will never know the endless possibilities waiting just beyond the shadows</p>

<h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
<span class="Clickable" id="part-two">Outside of the cave, </span>

a candle can be seen sitting atop a table with a lantern shining light upon it. The candle belongs to a forgetful but hard-working architect living in the medieval era. Every night he comes home from a long day at work, hangs up his lantern, sits at his desk facing the window, and lights a new candle so he can begin his work. Sometimes, on particularly dark nights <span class="Clickable"id= "third-change"> the man may light two candles </span> to help illuminate the shadow which his body casts. Even though the work he must do when he gets home is quick and easy he is always in a rush to get it done so he is ready to wake up early again for work the next day. <span class="Clickable" id="second-change2">Apart from the occasional day</span>, while he is rushing the man almost always forgets to extinguish his candle before bed. While in bed the lantern casts a shadow out of his top-story room window to who knows where. <span class="Clickable" id="fourth-change">Besides any people passing by the open door with a lantern of their own</span>, the candle lies there undisturbed until it burns out and is replaced when the man gets home the next night. 

<p>Nick Sousanis’s concept of Seeing Double is seeing two views that piece together to make one. Without either view, things will make less sense and seem not whole. An example is the human eye, when you close one eye your depth perception changes and you can no longer see the things that the eye which is closed was seeing. To me Double Seeing is like seeing the big picture, you grasp all the important aspects rather than focusing on the minor details. The events inside the cave are all created from Flatness which is a lack of Double Seeing. When the architect replaces the candle all he is doing is illuminating his pages, but for the civilization in the cave he is powering their religion. The civilization believes this candle melting and growing closer to the table is their god flying across the sky and then descending into the underworld each day. While the candle is lit, the architect goes off to sleep, but the civilization wakes up to start its day. Even on the rare night that the architect does remember to blow out his candle the people of the cave are still sure that it is their god and he is gifting them with a longer day. The two worlds are connected by a candle, but while the architect sees the full truth, the civilization remains trapped in their illusion, unaware of the reality beyond their shadows.
